= Observer pattern

====
Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define
a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any
events that happen to the object (subject) theyâ€™re observing.
====

Observer represent one-to-many relationship between objects
so that when one object changes state, all its dependents
are notified and updated automatically.

The object that change he state is called subject, the other objects
are observers, so we have one subject and many observers.

This kind of interaction is also known as publish-subscribe.
The subject is the publisher of notifications. It sends out these notifications without having to know who its observers are.
